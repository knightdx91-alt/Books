show_tell_check.py — draft-time show-vs-tell gate for the whole book.

The pipeline's standing failure mode: when a chapter runs short of the word
floor, the easy fill is REFLECTION (a character explaining what a moment meant)
instead of SCENE (dialogue, physical action, sensory event). That reads as
telling, and it compounds into "too descriptive / not enough showing." The
book-evaluator keeps catching it downstream, at polish. This catches it at draft.

It measures four telling-signals per chapter and flags the worst paragraphs so
you can convert them to scene BEFORE the gate, not after:

  1. DIALOGUE SHARE — % of words inside quotes. Very low = a chapter with no
     one talking, usually pure interiority. (Not a hard rule; set-pieces run low.)
  2. FILTER VERBS — "he felt / knew / realized / understood / saw / noticed /
     sensed / thought / seemed / was aware." These narrate an experience at one
     remove instead of rendering it. Rate per 1,000 words.
  3. ABSTRACTION / MEANING-MARKERS — "it was the kind/sort/shape/thing of...",
     "the fact that", "which was", "meant that", "the truth was", plus aphoristic
     present-tense generalizations ("a man could...", "the way you..."). This is
     the narrated-meaning tic.
  4. NAMED EMOTION — "felt grief/relief/shame/fear/..." (naming the feeling
     instead of showing it in the body). the deep-POV #1 rule is the opposite.

It also flags SCENE-END CODAS: the last paragraph of a scene/chapter that is
pure interiority (no dialogue, no concrete action) — the "here's what it all
meant" summary that should usually be cut or dramatized.

HEURISTIC, not truth. A flagged paragraph might be earned deep-POV shown
in the body — read it before cutting. The point is a draft-time smoke alarm.

Thresholds (per 1,000 words) are advisory WARN lines, tuned to a
the target register (deep POV legitimately runs some interiority):
    filter verbs   > 9.0     -> heavy
    abstraction    > 6.0     -> heavy
    named emotion  > 2.5     -> heavy
    dialogue share < 8%      -> note (single-POV set-piece; check it earns it)
A chapter with 2+ heavies is worth a convert-to-scene pass.
