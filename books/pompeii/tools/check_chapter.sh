# Consolidated per-chapter gate runner for Pompeii (working title).
# Usage: bash tools/check_chapter.sh <chapter-number>
# Runs EVERY gate a finalized chapter must pass, so none is ever skipped:
#   1. style_check   (too-flowery: simile/em-dash/adverb + cross-chapter n-grams)
#   2. grammar_check (HARD: doubled words, spacing, a/an; + long-sentence report)
#   3. rhythm_check  (flat triplets / unsanctioned anaphora)
#   4. show_tell     (too-descriptive: filter/abstraction; chapter row + book heavies)
#   5. voice_wear    (per-POV device calcification / retired phrases)
#   6. word floor    (>= 5000 words)
# Genesis Floor >= 8.5 (book-evaluator) and the PACING check are judgement gates —
# this script prints a reminder; they are not mechanical.
